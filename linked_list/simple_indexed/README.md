# Simply Linked List

Semi-robust singly linked list implementation in java. Developed by [David Dulce](https://github.com/arkantrust).

This project uses the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) so you don't need to have maven installed to run it.

## Demonstration

There's a simple demonstration of the linked list in the [`ListApp`](./src/main/java/me/arkantrust/ListApp.java) class.

## QA

Tests can be run with the following command from the root directory:

### Linux - MacOS

```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Windows

```bash
mvnw.cmd test
```
